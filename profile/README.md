## Purpose

**Welcome to IISD-ELA's public organization view!**  
The IISD-ELA GitHub organization is a hub for information sheets, open-source code, and reproducible research that supports whole-ecosystem science carried out at our 58 lakes and their watersheds in Ontario, Canada. Whether you're a researcher, collaborator, or a curious member of the public, our GitHub offers a window into some of the methods, infrastructure, and scientific work driving our scientific research.  

At the present time, most of our repositories are private (not visible to the public). Some of the repos of wider interest are highlighted in the [Key Public Repositories](#key-public-repositories) section below.

## Key Public Repositories
For visitors interested in exploring IISD-ELA data and research, the following public repositories are particularly relevant:

- 📌 [**`info-sheets`**](https://github.com/IISD-ELA/info-sheets)  
  Contains comprehensive information sheets on IISD-ELA datasets, including sampling methods, field gear, data processing, and analytical approaches. These are an essential resource for users of our data, whether obtained from a data request or one of our public data repository packages.  

- 📌 [**`iisd-ela-publications`**](https://github.com/IISD-ELA/iisd-ela-publications)  
  Contains backend files, documentation, and resources related to the online [IISD-ELA publications search engine app](https://iisd-ela-pubs-search-engine.streamlit.app/).  

## Repository Organization by Topic Tags
Our topic tags help categorize repositories across the IISD-ELA GitHub organization so you can easily discover related work. Below is a list of topic tags by data type (e.g., `chemistry`, `fish`), with a link to all repositories tagged with each topic. In addition, you may notice that our repositories also include tags that describe project-specific context (e.g., `analysis`), which will further help you navigate our GitHub organization. Please note that some tags may not have any public repositories associated with them yet, resulting in a blank page once you click the link.
